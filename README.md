# PathfinderGenerator

### Pathfinder generator is a loot creation mobile application for the Pathfinder role-playing game. ([wiki](https://www.pathfinder-fr.org/Wiki/))
It is based on the wiki's [Treasure Generator](https://www.pathfinder-fr.org/Wiki/Pathfinder-RPG.G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rateur%20de%20tr%C3%A9sors.ashx).  
It is also based on this [table](/Ressources/Generateur_de_tresor.ods) for the distribution of materials and the generation of gems and objets d'art.  
Some of the missing probabilities were calculated manually and arbitrarily.
